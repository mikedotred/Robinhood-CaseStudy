* The company name is Robinhood, promptly named after the story of Robin Hood in which a Robin Hood steals from the rich and gives to the poor.

* The company was incorporated on April 18, 2013.
* The company was founded by CEO Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. Stanford roomies and classmates who took their talents to New York City after graduating in 2009 and built two finance companies. The companies were a prequel to Robinhood, Celeris  was a n algorythimic  trading technology startup and Chronos research in which they would sell their own trading software to hedge fund companies. While in this workspace they noticed that the big time Wall Street trading firms were paying a very very small fee to trade stocks while the average person in America would have to pay a heavily charged commision to execute a trade. This is when the idea of Robinhoof starts to come into creation, after seeing the big difference in how much people were paying they would move back to California and begin building their own software for a financial product that would give access to the finacnial markey to everyone from the bottom to the top. This company would cause a shift in the trade and investment markey by providing a commission free investing platform that is available to anybody with a smartphone.
* Initially in 2013 Robinhood raised 3 million funded by Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Rothenberg Ventures, along with Tim Draper, Howard Lindzon plus more power players from the finance sector. By August 2021 over ten rounds of funding brought them up to over 5.3 billion dollars. All of these funds raised have always came through the same venture companies who helped them get their start plus a few new comers who see the potential in the companies future as well as have high faith in its founders. The company also creates revenue in several different ways that creates the incentive to keep these venture companies opening up there pocket books. One way they make money is by charging for the use of their API (Application Programming Interface) or software that would allow other companies to build upon their trading system, which would save a company who is already in this business years of development and allow them to instantly upgrade their system. Another way they make money is through the Robinhood Gold subscrition which allows users to trade on margin , make larger deposits, and gives them access to proffessional Morningstar reports. Being able to trade on margin helps because it lets the customer spend money they would usually have to wait a three day period for. This accounts for 30% of their revenue, the other 70% comes from something called Payment flow order. Payment flow order is the reason why this company is able to do commission free trades and fractional trades, it is based off of the need and wants of the stock exchange companies to keep a high and consistent volume of trades occuring within their market. When a user makes a trade on Robinhood , Robinhood then sends the trade to a larger stock exchange after that the larger stock exchange pays Robinhood a fee for allowing them to run the trade on there stock exchange. Sometimes this can cause a conflict as seen in the meme driven Gamestop and Blackberry trade hault because when looking for the highest bidder instead of the quickest trade the customer gets left at a stand still which could potentially cause them to lose money. When it comes down to it Robinhood had to make a business decision and do what was best for the company, it may have caused alot of bad publicity but as seen through the user growth it did not stop much.
## Business Activities 
* Robinhood's sole purpose is to put the power of investing and trading that would usually be exclusive to the big companies and wealthy into the hands of every person in the United States at a commision free rate. The problem was the high fees and minimums that the average person would have to pay to invest or trade, their solution was to cut the costs and create a investing tool that would cut out the middle man and service the public. The market was instantly disrupted after this due to the high influx of new traders that were able to participate due to Robinhood's use of fractional shares, which meant you could buy a piece of the stock instead of having to pay the full amount.
* Robinhood's intended customer base are first time traders, millenials, and everyone that comes after. The market size that Robinhood targets is basically one that refills everyday, by seeking people who have never traded before they are always adding new users and not only retaining their users. The amount of users the company gains rises yearly, in 2022 they had an active 10.8 million users. The way that robinhood provides commission-free trading seperates them lightyears ahead of their competition. They app is downloadable for free and within the app they allow people to trade with an amount as low as a dollar. The big backing they have always had is also one of the things that put them ahead almost instantly, before the app was released there were 340,000 people already on the waitlist and this was just on IOS. The competitor cannot provide commission free trading they still have to charge 5 to 7 dollars per trade that puts them behind instantly as well. The amount of products that are available within Robinhood are another reason the competitors are undermanned, from cash cards, crypto, and its newly initiated 24 hour market its really no competition. The technology, creatitive problem solving, and huge financial backing makes it almost unfair.

* They have several new products that they have rolled out over the years and all of them are backed through some classic technologies and some new ones. When it comes to apps and data as well as how the app looks as far as the text, script, colors, and asthetics they use several different technologies some of them are Python (programming language), React (Java script library used for building user interfaces), NGINX (open source web provider), PostgreSQL, Ubuntu (OS for pc,tablet,cloud), Redis, Bootstrap, Amazon EC2, Sass (stylish sheets), Django (web framework), Redux, Kafka(pub-sub messaging system), RabbitMQ, Swift (new program language for Cocoa), Golang, Kotlin, Memcached (memory object caching system), Django REST fram, Airflow (author,schedule and monitor data pipelines), Celery,Rxjava,Faust (library for streaming apps in python). Some of the key ones are of course Python the universal code language as well as Amazon EC2 which is a pay per use cloud services this just adds on to the amount of information they can handle and analyze later. Also Kafka provides a way for them to send messages to subsribers and Ubuntu makes the app work well on mobile devices. They also have addons or utilites that they implement as well such as google analytics ( an easy way to get analytic data), elasticsearch (am open source, distributed, RESTful search engine), and retrofit (type safe http for android and Java). These together allow an app that was originally IOS (iphone) only to be able to run on android phones which increased its user base exponentially. The developer tools used to build and maintain Robinhood are Github, Git , Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Webpack, Babel, Terraform, Kibana, Grafana, Sentry, Logstash, Vagrant, Prometheus, Consul, ELK, Vault, Zookeeper, StatsD, Fabric, Salt, Phabricator, Sensu, and LXC. These tools are used to ensure that the coding for the app and updates are easily followed and tracked. These tools are what let all the developers use the apps and data together to combine and create the application. The business technology list is a much shorter list but very important because this is how the company communicates and collaborates on ideas in single clicks. The apps used are Slack, G Suite, Confluence, and Asana. All of these are combined to roll out several features crypto investing, retirement packages, and even the cash card that allows you to treat your Robinhood account like a bank account.
* Robinhood lives in a few domains such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and lending.
* In the past 5 to 10 years the industry has went from non existent to now being a worldwide staple in how people move money throughout the world and not have to worry about conversion or if the dollar is up or down. Ten years ago Robinhood was just being founded and people had to pay 7 to 10 dollars per trade and could only participate if they had enough money to purchase the full stock. Bitcoin was created in 2009 but was pretty much inaccessible unless you were really into computer and in the know. Cryptocurrency went from something that the average person knew nothing about to fast forward everybody that knows about cash knows about crypto. The amount of fees that it would cost to purchase crypto was also similar to the fees that were associated with trading except it would be alot higher monetarily. Gas fees which happen when you purchase, sell, or move crypto could sometimes be higher than the amount of crypto purchased. Robinhood would bring in crypto into their trading market slowly but always made sure the main coins BTC, ETH, and even DOGE. Initially you could not move your crypto but now they have upgraded to where you can move your crypto to a wallet for a reasonable price. In 2023 you can purchase anything with crypto from sports event tickets, cars, to even a house. The accessibility to all of the investment opportunites as well trading options have went from being a guy in a suit that you would have to come see in person to being on an application in your pocket. The freedom that was passed on shifted the domain and provided an influx of users , with this comes more financial losses to users because most people are not knowledgabel enough to make investments and follow meme ooin culture. This however is not Robinhood's fault because they have a several LEARN links all over their site that gives basic explanations to how the app is used and what type of trading you want to do.
* The other major companies that are in this domain are Fidelty Investments, Cash App, E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, CHarles Schwab, WeBull, Merrill Edge, Trade Station, and Gatsby.
## Results
* The results that Robinhood has seen has been phenomenel, although its seen its bumps and hurdles it has flourished year after year. The impact made by this company has transcended the financial and trading landscape and tapped into actual popular culture. When a product not only solves a problem but continues to provide the customer with more and more reasons to continuously use the application it pretty much runs itself at that point. Robinhood generated 1.35 billion in the year 2022 and even though that is a huge amount of money due to the GameStop and Blackberry incident they declined 25% from the year before. Even after this they still had 10.8 million active users and upped their assets under management to 89 billion by the end of the second quarter of 2023. They have added retirement to their bag of tricks as well they are the only IRA with a match, you get a 1% match, custom recommended portfolio, and no commission fees as usual. They also provide 24/7 customer service so users feel like they can reach out at anytime. They have also extened their market time to 24 hours a day 5 days a week, which is a change from the original 9:30 AM - 4 PM Eastern Time. This is a game changer and allows even more freedom in trading. This business as created millions of traders who would have never been able to.
* Some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use are revenue, net income, users, assets under management, and company valuation. When talking revenue their total net revenue increased 5 percent to 380 million. The Transaction-based revenues decreased 11 percent to 186 million. Options sat at 124 million while cryptocurrencies decreased 24 percent to 39 million, and equities decreased 32 percent to 21 million. The net interest revenue went up 30 percent to 167 million and was pushed by the higher short-term intrest rates and growth in interest earning assets. The Net Loss was 166 million which is an improvement fro the year before by about 0.01 per share. Operating Expenses decreased 0.2 percent to 534 million, and the operating expenses prior to share-based compensation decreased 12 percent as well. The monthly active users decreased 0.8 million to make 11.4 million due mainly to a volitile market and users being more cautious. Assets Under Custody or how many assets they are managing decreased 4 percent to 62 bilion mostly due to the market not doing well. The net deposits were 4.8 billion which showed a 30 percent growth rate and the average revenue per user went up to 3 dollars from 63 to 66. The cash and cash equivalent was up .1 billion pushing it 6.3 billion dollars. So with looking at this data the company is doing good in most places but have room for improvement as well, some of these variables are a direct result of the market being unstable so they have to just focus on what they can control which is how its users recieve information, provide more infomation, be transparent, and continue to open up different doors and options for the user. Considering all of the drama and bad attention the Gamestop trade hault brought it was very good to see that so little users stopped using Robinhood, with all the new products rolling out it looks like Robinhood is primed to take off even further from its competition.
* Their is a huge gap in users and performance from Robinhood and the closest competitor being over 6-8 million in Fideltiy Investments and even more when you bring up Cash App, E*Trade, and TD Ameritrade. They are absolutely running the domain and choosing which way the market will be ran and shifted because the other companies have to figuere out how to keep their users and not have them switch to Robinhood out of pure convience and money saved.
## Recommendations
* Although Robinhood has several products and read me type links on their page, I would propose giving web classes on trading definitons and strategies for a free in order to increase revenue as well as create better traders in which will be able to spend more money within the app and spend more time using other Robinhood services such as Robinhood Gold. I would also suggest that they create a robinhood crypto wallet similar to coinbase in which you could house your NFT's as well as transfer crypto from other wallets you own. This would help consolidate the users crypto as well as add more time spent in the Robinhood app.
* The techonology used for the web classes would be zoom mostly as well the developer and data tools that are already in place. The crypto wallet will have to use blockchain technology to connect all of the wallets and allow the crypto to freely flow in between.
* These technologies are appropriate because they would allow the users and Robinhood to easily accomplish these things by allowing the students and instructors to meet on a weekly or bi weekly basis as well as the blockchain providing actual infrastructure to the crypto wallet.
